# Data-Analysis-of-IPL-Balls
This project focuses on performing an in-depth analysis of the IPL ball-by-ball dataset to gain insights into match performance, team strategies, and player contributions. By examining over 190,000 entries detailing every ball bowled, including runs scored, wickets taken, and player involvement, the analysis aims to uncover trends and patterns within the matches. The dataset includes information such as batting and bowling teams, specific player actions, extras bowled, and dismissals, allowing for granular exploration of game dynamics. Using this data, the project can identify key players, evaluate team performance, and highlight impactful overs or match-turning points. The insights derived from this analysis will provide a comprehensive understanding of how each ball contributes to the outcome of the game, making it a valuable resource for cricket enthusiasts, analysts, and strategists.
